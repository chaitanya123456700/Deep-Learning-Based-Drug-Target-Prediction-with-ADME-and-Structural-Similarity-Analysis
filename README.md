# 🧬 AI-Powered Multi-Target Drug Discovery Platform

> An end-to-end AI-driven drug discovery platform that predicts biological targets, evaluates drug-likeness, assesses toxicity, analyzes molecular similarity, visualizes 3D structures, retrieves bioactivity information, searches scientific literature, and estimates synthetic accessibility from a single SMILES string.

---

# Overview

Drug discovery is a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process involving multiple stages such as target identification, compound screening, toxicity assessment, pharmacokinetic evaluation, and biological validation.

This platform integrates Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Molecular Informatics, and Cheminformatics into a single interactive system capable of performing multiple computational analyses from a single molecular structure.

The platform accepts a **SMILES representation** of a molecule and performs:

- Multi-target prediction using Deep Learning
- Drug-likeness (ADME) analysis
- Toxicity prediction
- Molecular similarity search
- 3D molecular visualization
- Bioactivity retrieval from ChEMBL
- Literature search from PubMed
- Synthetic accessibility estimation
- AI-generated interpretation of predictions

---

# Features

- ADME Property Calculation
- Toxicity Assessment
- Molecular Similarity Search
- Interactive 3D Molecular Viewer

# Dataset Construction

The dataset was automatically collected from the **ChEMBL Database**.

Selected biological targets include:

- EGFR
- ABL1
- BRAF
- VEGFR2
- JAK2
- DRD2
- HTR2A
- ADRB2
- COX2
- ACHE
- HDAC1
- MAOA
- ESR1
- AR

For every target:

- Bioactivity records were downloaded
- IC50 values were extracted
- Molecules with IC50 ≤ 1000 nM were labeled Active
- Remaining compounds were labeled Inactive

The collected data was transformed into a **multi-label classification dataset**, where each molecule may interact with multiple biological targets.

# Molecular Representation

Instead of directly feeding SMILES into neural networks, every molecule is converted into a **2048-bit Morgan Fingerprint**.

Morgan Fingerprints encode:

- Atomic neighborhoods
- Bond connectivity
- Circular molecular environments

Advantages:

- Fixed-length representation
- Captures molecular topology
- Efficient for machine learning
- Widely used in cheminformatics
